### Getting Started

samlet-chat comes in two versions &ndash; you can use the cloud service or self-host the software on your own server. Both versions have the same set of features. With the cloud service, you get server management, security and performance tuning, and updates taken care of. If you prefer to have more control over the software or if you prefer to store the data on your own server, you should choose the self-hosted version.

Depending on your use-case and needs, proceed with the right option for you to learn more:

 - [**Cloud Service**](/installation/cloud-service/README.md) &ndash; If you don't want to worry about managing servers, updating, and performing security and performance tuning. This is the simpler approach.

 - [**Self-hosting**](self-hosting/README.md) &ndash; If you're tech-savvy, if you want more control over samlet-chat, or if you want to host the data on your own server. This is for advanced users.
