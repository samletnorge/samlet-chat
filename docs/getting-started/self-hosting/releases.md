### samlet-chat Releases

samlet-chat uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) to denote releases. The current major version family is `1.x.y` and the project is considered to be stable and there won't be any breaking changes across releases. It is highly recommended you keep your installation updated for security and performance reasons; samlet-chat will notify you in the logs when a new release is made.

If you download a binary release for your system, please follow the [binary installation instructions](installation/on-your-server/release-binaries.md).

If you are building from source, follow the [source installation instructions](installation/on-your-server/compiling-source.md).

Releases are signed with PGP keys that expire every year or so, so different releases may be signed by different keys. The newer key will be signed by the preceeding key as a proof of succession. Find the appropriate key for each release:

- **Key for signed releases made between 2019-09-29 and 2021-03-22 (latest)**
