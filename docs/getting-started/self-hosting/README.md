### Self-hosting samlet-chat

samlet-chat is a Go-based application that uses PostgreSQL for the backend database. One of the benefits of Go is that it produces statically linked binaries that require no runtime environments (other than the operating system itself) or dependencies. This greatly simplifies distribution, deployment, and upgrades.

It is strongly recommend you [review the system requirements](system-requirements.md) to run samlet-chat. Following this, you can [install samlet-chat](/installation/self-hosting/README.md). After this, you can [configure samlet-chat](/configuration/README.md) to suit your requirements.

{% hint style='tip' %}
You don't need to install Go and other build dependencies to self-host samlet-chat; you'll only need those if you're compiling samlet-chat from source.
