### System Requirements

The Go programming language supports a fairly [wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures](https://golang.org/doc/install#requirements); if you are covered in there, then there's a good chance things will work for you.

#### Hardware requirements

samlet-chat is pretty lightweight, but we recommend having at least 64 MB of free RAM and at least 30 MB of free disk space. This does not include the [requirements for running the PostgreSQL server](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=3066.htm). You may, of course, choose to use a separate server or a cloud provider for the PostgreSQL database.

samlet-chat has been verified to be working on the following hardware architectures: `amd64`, `x86`

#### Software requirements

To run samlet-chat, you will need access to a PostgreSQL database version 9.6 or later. There aren't any other software requirements, unless you're [compiling from source](/installation/self-hosting/on-your-server/compiling-source.md).

##### Supported operating systems

###### Linux

Nearly every Linux distribution should be able to run samlet-chat, as long as there's an accessible PostgreSQL server.

Occasionally, using [release binaries](/installation/self-hosting/on-your-server/release-binaries.md) might not work if you use a C library version different from the one the release binary was compiled in or a different `libc` implementation altogether (`glibc`, `musl`, or something else). In that case, you may be required to compile from source for your system. [Compiling](/installation/self-hosting/on-your-server/compiling-source.md) for your architecture should be simple enough.

samlet-chat has been verified to be working on the following distributions: Arch Linux, Debian 9.12
